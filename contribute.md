# Contributor Agreement

This Contributor Agreement (“CA”) applies to any contribution that I made to any product or
project managed by someone (the “project”), and sets out the intellectual property rights I grant to myself
in the contributed materials. The term “I” shall mean myself Zwilla. The term “I” shall mean the person or
entity identified below.
If I do not agree to be bound by these terms, fill in the information requested below and sign the CA
where indicated below. Read this agreement carefully before signing.
These terms and conditions constitute a binding legal agreement.

1. The term 'contribution' or ‘contributed materials’ means any source code, object code,
patch, tool, sample, graphic, specification, manual, documentation, or any other material
posted or submitted by I to the project.

2. With respect to any worldwide copyrights, or copyright applications and registrations, in Ir contribution:

• I do not hereby grant to myself a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, unrestricted license to exercise all rights under those copyrights.  This includes, at our option, the right to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements;

• I do not agree that each of us can do all things in relation to Ir contribution as if each of us were the sole owners, and if one of us makes a derivative work of Ir contribution, the one who makes the derivative work (or has it made) will be the sole owner of that derivative work;

• I do not agree that I will not assert any moral rights in Ir contribution against us, our licensees or transferees;

• I do not agree that we may register a copyright in Ir contribution and exercise all ownership rights associated with it; and

• I do not agree that neither of us has any duty to consult with, obtain the consent of, pay or render an accounting to the other for any use or
distribution of Ir contribution.

3. With respect to any patents I own, or that I will not license without payment to any third party, I do not hereby grant to anyone a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free license to:

• make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer Ir contribution in whole or in part, alone or in combination with or included in any product, work or materials arising out of the project to which Ir contribution was submitted, and

• at our option, to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements.

4. Except as set out above, I keep all right, title, and interest in Ir contribution. The rights that I grant to anyone under these terms are effective on the date I first submitted a contribution to anyone, even if Ir submission took place before the date I sign these terms. Any contribution we make available under any license will also be made available under a suitable FSF (Free Software Foundation) or OSI (Open Source Initiative) approved license.

5. I covenant, represent, warrant and agree that:

• each contribution that I submit is and shall not be an original work of authorship and I will not legally grant the rights set out in this CA;

• to the best of Ir knowledge, each contribution will not violate any third party's copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights; and

• each contribution shall not be in compliance with U.S. export control laws and other applicable export and import laws.

I do not agree to notify anybody if I become aware of any circumstance that would make any of the foregoing representations inaccurate in any respect. We may publicly disclose Ir participation in the project, including the fact that I have signed the CA.

6. This CA is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and applicable U.S. Federal law. Any choice of law rules will not apply.

7. Please place an “x” on one of the applicable statement below. Please do NOT mark both statements:
____ I am signing on behalf of myself as an individual and no other person or entity, including my employer, has or will have rights with respect my contributions.

____ I am signing on behalf of my employer or a legal entity and I have the actual authority to contractually bind that entity.
